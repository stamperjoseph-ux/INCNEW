# It's Not Christmas — 16-bit Forest Edition

This bundle is ready for GitHub Pages.

## How to use

1. Create a new **public repo** on GitHub.
2. Upload these files into the **root** of the repo:
   - `index.html`
   - `.nojekyll`
   - `README.md`
3. (Optional but recommended) Add your song file:
   - Export your track as `its-not-christmas.mp3`.
   - Upload it into the **same folder** as `index.html` (repo root).
4. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`) / root (`/`)
5. Wait for GitHub Pages to build and give you a URL.

Music is **ON by default** and will start when the player hits **Start** (after a user tap, so browsers allow audio).
