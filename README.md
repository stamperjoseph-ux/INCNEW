# It's Not Christmas — Home for Christmas (Easier Version)

This is a tuned-easier build of the game:

- Slower scroll speed
- Fewer obstacles
- Higher, floatier jumps
- Softer gravity
- 5 hearts instead of 3

## Files

- `index.html` — the full game
- `NOJEKYLL` — upload this to repo root so GitHub Pages doesn't treat it as Jekyll
- (You still need to upload `its-not-christmas.mp3` yourself.)

## Setup

1. In your GitHub repo (e.g. INCNEW), delete the old `index.html` and any `.nojekyll`/`NOJEKYLL` files.
2. Upload:
   - `index.html`
   - `NOJEKYLL`
3. Make sure your song file is in the same place, named:
   - `its-not-christmas.mp3`
4. Check **Settings → Pages** is still set to serve from the root branch.
5. Visit your Pages URL and play!
