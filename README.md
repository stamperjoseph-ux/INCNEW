# It's Not Christmas — Home for Christmas (Easier v2)

Changes from previous build:
- Slower scroll speed (much more forgiving)
- Obstacles spawn less frequently and are more spread out
- Tall obstacles are rarer
- 5 hearts total
- Heart pickups (heal + score)
- Star pickups (temporary shield + score)
- Shield lets you plow through obstacles without losing hearts

## Files

- `index.html` — the full easier game
- `NOJEKYLL` — upload this to repo root if you want a visible nojekyll marker

You still need to upload your song file:
- `its-not-christmas.mp3` in the same directory as `index.html`.
