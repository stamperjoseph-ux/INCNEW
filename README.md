# It's Not Christmas — Home for Christmas Edition (INC v3)

This bundle is ready for GitHub Pages.

## How to use

1. Create a new **public repo** on GitHub (or reuse your `INCNEW` repo).
2. Upload these files into the **root** of the repo:
   - `index.html`
   - `.nojekyll`
   - `README.md`
3. Add your song file:
   - Export your track as `its-not-christmas.mp3`.
   - Upload it into the **same folder** as `index.html` (repo root).
4. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`) / root (`/`)
5. Wait for GitHub Pages to build and give you a URL.

Music is **ON by default** and starts when the player hits **Start**.

The entire run is tuned to roughly match the full song length (~2:51). Reach your wife + baby before the song ends to see the full cinematic ending.
