# It's Not Christmas — Home for Christmas Edition (INC v3c)

Same as v3, but with a safer initialization so the player and sprites
are always created before the game loop runs.

To use:
1. Upload `index.html`, `.nojekyll`, and this `README.md` to your repo root.
2. Make sure `its-not-christmas.mp3` is also in the repo root.
3. GitHub Pages will serve the updated game.
