# It’s Not Christmas — Home for Christmas (Final Build)

This folder contains the front-end files for the **It’s Not Christmas** promo game.

## Files

- `index.html` – full game (side-scroller, hearts, stars, hug ending)
- `NOJEKYLL` – helps GitHub Pages serve this as static files

## Add your song

Put your song file in the **same folder** as `index.html`:

- `its-not-christmas.mp3`

The game expects that exact filename.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a new repo on GitHub (or use an empty one).
2. Upload:
   - `index.html`
   - `NOJEKYLL`
   - `README.md`
   - `its-not-christmas.mp3`
3. Enable GitHub Pages for the repo (Source: `main` / root).
4. Visit the Pages URL and play.
