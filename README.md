# It's Not Christmas — Home for Christmas Edition (INC v4)

This bundle is ready for GitHub Pages.

## Files

- `index.html` — full side-scroller game (home-for-Christmas edition)
- `.nojekyll` — prevents GitHub Pages from treating this as a Jekyll site
- `README.md` — these instructions

## Setup

1. Create / open your **public** repo (e.g. `INCNEW`).
2. Upload these files into the **root** of the repo:
   - `index.html`
   - `.nojekyll`
   - `README.md`
3. Export your song as **`its-not-christmas.mp3`** and upload it to the **same folder** as `index.html`.
4. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`) / root (`/`)
5. Wait for GitHub Pages to build and then open your site URL.

The game:

- Auto-scrolls over ~2:51 to match the song length.
- Uses left/right to move, up to jump, down to duck/slide.
- Features upgraded pine forests with dark back layers, snowy front pines, and tiny Christmas lights.
- Ends in a cinematic sequence where you make it home to your wife + baby if you survive the full run.
